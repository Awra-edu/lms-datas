    "content": "Arrays and linked lists are fundamental data structures used to store collections of data. Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for constant-time access to elements by index. Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations.",
